# GitOps

The term "GitOps" itself was coined by [Weaveworks](https://www.weave.works/blog/gitops-operations-by-pull-request). 

A key part of GitOps is the idea of "environments-as-code": describing your deployments declaratively using files (for example, Kubernetes manifests) stored in a Git repository.
